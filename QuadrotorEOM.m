%Name: ASEN-3801 Lab 4 QuadrotorEOM.m
%Date: 10/14/2025
%Authors: Alex Godbout, Christopher Westerlund, Damien Wilson, Maria Cristina Sarno
%Inputs:
%    t is time; var is the 12 x
%    1 aircraft state vector; g is the acceleration due to gravity; m is mass; I is the inertia matrix; d, km,
%    nu, and mu are the remaining quadrotor parameters; motor_forces = [f1; f2; f3; f4] is
%    the 4 x 1 vector of motor forces, and var_dot is the 12 x 1 derivative of the state vector. Include
%    attitude dynamics and kinematics using the Euler angle attitude representation
%Outputs: 

function var_dot = QuadrotorEOM(t, var, g, m, I, d, km, nu, mu, motor_forces)
